# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTION
This is my machine learning project , where I explore the problem of **fake news detection** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification models. The goal is to build a model that can automatically classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their content. The dataset to train the model has been taken from KAGGLE

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To create a machine learning pipeline that can detect whether a news article is fake or real using text data.
